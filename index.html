          <p>During a succeful marketing career I was able to work with HTML, CSS, and a variety of CMS platforms. Although I enjoyed defining marketing strategy and executing successful campaigns, the technical aspects of my positions were always the most exciting for me. I always loved the challenges of working through code, the excitement of finding a solution to a tough problem, and being able to see my completed work in real-time. After a few contract roles and struggling to find a home in marketing where I could also flex my technical skills. I decided to take the leap and focus on the work that I truly love. I enrolled in a full-time immersive web development course at General Assembly(GA). The experience has been fantastic, although certainly overwhelming at points as we do learn a lot quickly. I've gained experience in a variety of coding languages from front-end to back-end and great exposure to working on projects, both individually and on a team. I'm now looking forward to taking these skills and contributing to an organization as I learn and grow with the company.</p>

        <p> In my personal life I love to push my body physically and mentally and can often be found outside enjoying nature. Although I love a good adventure I always take a safe and practical approch when participating in any activity. My desire to push myself while also being practical is a trait I bring with me to my work.

              The first project I tackled at GA was a tic-tac-toe game. With just a few weeks of formal learning under my belt, I'm proud to say I succeed with the project and met requirements on my first submission. For me the big focus on the project was using Javascript to build out the front end including the game logic. I also used HTML and CSS to build and style the page and JQuery to manipulate the page after actions were taken. I used JSON and AJAX to make calls the the API. Although I was overwhelmed to start the project, I found myself learning a lot throughout the way and enjoyed the challenges. One of the most valuable things I learned during this project was to break up a larger problem into many smaller problems and tackle them indivdually.
