          <p>Former marketer turned web developer. As a marketer I was able to work with HTML, CSS, and a variety of CMS platforms. The technical aspects of my positions were always the most exciting so I decided to focus on the work I truly love. I enrolled in a immersive web development course at General Assembly. I've gained experience in a variety of coding languages and great exposure working on projects, both individually and on a team. I'm now looking forward to taking these skills and contributing to a team as I learn and grow with the organization.

              The first project I tackled at GA was a tic-tac-toe game. With just a few weeks of formal learning under my belt, I'm proud to say I succeed with the project and met requirements on my first submission. For me the big focus was using Javascript to build out the front-end including the game logic. I also used HTML and CSS to build and style the page and JQuery to manipulate the page after actions were taken. I used JSON and AJAX to make calls the the API. Although I was overwhelmed to start the project, I found myself learning a lot throughout the way and enjoyed the challenges. One of the most valuable things I learned during this project was to break up a larger problem into many smaller problems and tackle them indivdually.
